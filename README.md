# Electronic Structure
Practical Sessions problems for the Electronic Structure course of the _Atomistic and Multiscale Computational Modelling_ Master Degree.

`/Practical Session 1` Gives an introduction to the diferent types of orbitals, STO, GTO, STO-NG, how to find their optimized parameters and visualizing their differences.

`/Practical Session 2` $H_2^+$ calculations with STO and STO-NG. PES and Wavefunction visualization.

`/Practical Session 3` Parametrized RHF programs for $H_2$ and $HHe^+$.

`/Practical Session 4` Full RHF for diatomic molecules using STO-NG basis set.
